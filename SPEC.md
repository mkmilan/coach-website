# Milan — Endurance Coaching Website (v1)

Goal: Convert Instagram visitors into **intro calls** by building trust with clear positioning, simple offer, and professional presentation.

## Primary CTA

- Secondary CTA: **Download a free training guide** (optional lead magnet)

## Site Map (v1)

1. `/` Home (single-page style is fine)

3. `/contact` Contact / Book call (can be same as section on Home)

> Keep it small. No blog needed. No SEO rabbit holes yet.

# 1) Home Page Outline (exact section order)

## A. Top Bar (minimal)

- Left: Name / Logo (text logo is fine)
- Right: Links: About • Coaching • Resources • Contact
- Button: **Book intro call**

### Must-have

- Mobile-first
- Sticky header optional

---

## B. Hero Section (above the fold)

### Goal

In 5 seconds the visitor understands:

- Who you help
- What you do
- Why you’re credible
- What to do next

### Copy (Option 1 — clean + scientific)

**Headline:** Evidence-based endurance coaching for thinking athletes  
**Subheadline:** I bridge sport science and real-world training for runners and triathletes — with a simple process, clear communication, and a focus on long-term progress.  
**CTA button:** Book an intro call  
**Secondary link:** See how coaching works

### Copy (Option 2 — more direct)

**Headline:** Smarter training. Less guesswork.  
**Subheadline:** Online coaching for runners and triathletes who want structure, feedback, and training decisions grounded in physiology — not trends.  
**CTA button:** Book an intro call  
**Secondary link:** What you get

### Small credibility line (under CTA)

UESCA Certified Triathlon Coach • Data + RPE • Individualized training

---

## C. “Start here” Micro-Section (3 bullets)

### Goal

Short, skimmable trust builder.

**Title:** What I optimize

- Aerobic base and durability (consistent training you can repeat)
- Threshold development (better sustained pace/power)
- Race execution + fueling strategy (simple and practical)

---

## D. About Section (honest + strategic)

### Goal

Show credibility without pretending you have decades of coaching.

**Title:** About Milan  
**Copy (paste-ready):**  
I’m Milan, a UESCA Certified Triathlon Coach with a focus on running and cycling. My style is evidence-based, but athlete-first — I combine training data (pace/power/HR) with RPE and real-life context.  
My goal is to help athletes train with clarity: understanding _why_ we do sessions, not just completing workouts. I’m currently building a small roster so I can give each athlete high attention and detailed feedback.

**Bullets (optional):**

- Certified: UESCA Triathlon Coach
- Tools: Intervals.icu / Stryd (if you use it for athletes)
- Approach: individualization, progressive overload, recovery respect

---

## E. Coaching Philosophy (your differentiator)

### Goal

This replaces “testimonials” early on.

**Title:** My coaching principles  
**Blocks (choose 4–6):**

1. **Training should be repeatable.** Consistency beats heroic weeks.
2. **Intensity has a cost.** We use hard sessions carefully, not constantly.
3. **Data needs context.** Numbers help, but the athlete’s feedback decides.
4. **Long-term > short-term.** Build durability first, then sharpen.
5. **Simple beats complicated.** Fewer key sessions, executed well.
6. **Education matters.** You learn your body and your training process.

---

## F. Offer Section (simple, no package circus)

### Goal

Make the “what you get” extremely clear.

**Title:** 1:1 Online Coaching  
**Short copy:**  
Personal training plan + ongoing feedback. Built around your schedule, goals, and how you actually respond to training.

### What’s included (paste-ready)

- Individual weekly training plan (run/cycle; tri optional later)
- Session feedback and adjustments based on performance + RPE
- Review of key workouts (pace/power/HR trends)
- Monthly progress check-in and next-step planning
- Guidance on fueling basics for training and race day
- Messaging support (set your boundary: e.g., 24–48h response)

### Optional “starter” offer (helps beginners convert)

**Title:** Training Audit (one-time)

- Review last 4–8 weeks of training
- Identify main limiter + priority fixes
- Provide 2-week sample structure
  > This can be a lower-friction entry point before full coaching.

---

## G. Who This Is For (qualification section)

### Goal

Attract the right athletes and repel the wrong ones (saves you time).

**Title:** Best fit athletes

- Age-group runners and triathletes
- People who like structure and feedback
- Athletes who want to understand training (not just follow blindly)
- Busy adults who need training integrated with life

**Not a fit (optional but useful):**

- Anyone seeking “quick hacks” or extreme weekly intensity
- Athletes who won’t communicate or never recover
- People who want a generic plan without feedback

---

## H. “Why work with me now?” (handles no testimonials)

### Goal

Address the elephant calmly.

**Title:** Why work with a developing coach?  
**Copy (paste-ready):**  
I’m building my coaching roster intentionally. That means you get high attention, careful planning, and a coach who is actively studying, refining, and staying current with best practice. I won’t promise magic — I’ll build a process you can trust, and we’ll measure progress honestly.

> Keep the tone confident, not apologetic.

---

## I. Process Section (3 steps)

### Goal

Reduce uncertainty.

**Title:** How coaching works

1. **Intro call (15–20 min):** goals, history, constraints, expectations
2. **Setup week:** zones/testing (if needed), schedule, first plan
3. **Train + iterate:** weekly updates, feedback loop, progressive build

---

## J. Resources Section (preview + link)

### Goal

Give value, prove expertise, keep people engaged.

**Title:** Free resources

- “3 mistakes athletes make with threshold training”
- “Simple fueling guide for long sessions”
- “How to structure a week around work shifts” (this is very ‘you’)  
  Button: View resources

---

## K. Contact / Book Section (bottom)

### Goal

Make next step effortless.

**Title:** Book an intro call

- Short line: “If you want structure and feedback, let’s talk.”
- Button: Book intro call
- Alternative: contact form (name, email, sport, goal, availability)

**Tiny FAQ below (optional):**

- “Do you coach beginners?” (answer honestly)
- “Do you require power meter?” (likely no)
- “How fast do you reply?” (set boundary)

---

# 2) Resources Page (simple template)

## Structure

- Title + short intro: “Practical sports science for endurance athletes.”
- List resources as cards:
  - Title
  - 2–3 bullet summary
  - Link to PDF / Notion / Google Doc / Instagram post
- Optional: email capture at bottom

### Starter resource ideas (pick 3)

1. Threshold training: what it is + common mistakes
2. Easy training: what “easy” should feel like (RPE anchors)
3. Fueling: carbs/hour starting points and progression
4. Long run structure: steady vs progression vs marathon-specific
5. Bike/run balance for triathletes without overuse injury

---

# 3) Contact Page (if separate)

- Repeat CTA: book call
- Minimal form
- Social links

---

# 4) Design Guidelines (fast, clean, trustworthy)

- Plenty of white space
- One accent color (match IG)

- Use simple icons (checkmarks, small lines)
